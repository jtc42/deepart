# deepart

Run ./scripts/install/install_all.sh to install. It will install the needed python dependencies, caffe, compile caffe, download the necessary weight file. After the installation has finished, run `python gen_deepart.py` which will save the output images into the `results` directory.

This is an implementation of the original neural style project by [Gatis et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).
